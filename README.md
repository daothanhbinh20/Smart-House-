# Smart House Simulator

## Overview
The aim of this java programme is to stimulate the energey consumption and energy generation of a smart house.In the house are a number of applicances which consume/generate electricity or consume water when they operate, meters that record the amound of water and electricity consumed/generated and a battery which stores excess electricity if the house happens to generat more than it needs. 

## House Smart House Works
The house has 4 types of appliances: CyclicFixed, CyclicVaries, RandomFixed and RandomVaries.
* CyclicFixed: appliances are always on for a specific number of hours everyday and consume or generate fixed amount of energy per hour.
* CyclicVaries: appliances are always on for a specific number of hours everyday and consume or generate a variable amount of energy per hour.
* RandomFixed: appliances are on at random times during the day (based on probability of being switched on) and consume or generate a fixed amount of energy per hour.
* RanddomVaries: appliances are on at random times during the day (based on probability of being switched on) and consume or generate a variable amount of energy per hour.

The program will measure the total energy consumed and energy saved and deduce the total consumtion cost.

## File Description
